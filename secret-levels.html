        The first secret level you can get to is the Oasis. To get there, you
        must load into a new game and open all three chests (the weapon, ammo,
        and rads chest) without killing any enemies. The first boss in the game,
        the Big Bandit, will then spawn. If you kill him quickly, the portal to
        the Oasis will open. Inside the Oasis there are crabs that shoot
        projectiles, and pirahnas that will attack you. After exiting you will
        be sent to the 3rd area (also known as the scrapyard), straight into the Big Dog boss fight.

        The second secret area you can get to is called the Pizza Sewers. You
        can only get here from the second area, the sewers. From the sewers,
        find the manhole cover and destroy it with any explosive weapon. This
        will cause a portal to the Pizza Sewers to spawn. In the pizza sewers
        you will find four turtles and one rat. The pizza sewers leads to the 
        4th area, but not to the Big Dog fight like the Oasis. This means that 
        it serves as a way to get extra RADS before fighting Big Dog.

        The third secret area you can get to is called Y.V's mansion. 
        To get here, you must pick up a screwdriver from the starting area, 
        carry it all the way to the scrapyard (third area) and hit a 
        golden car with it. Then you can press E to get in the car, and it 
        will transport you to Y.V's mansion. Y.V's mansion is an important level 
        as it is the place you can most easily get golden weapons. Golden weapons are 
        guns that you can store after going through a portal with them. Each character can store
        one golden weapon that they can bring with them at the start of a run.

        The fourth secret level is located in the scrapyard and the snowy area. It is called 
        the Crown Vault. To get there you must first locate a kite-shaped stone statue. Hit it a couple times
        (but not too many or it will break) and the center will break away. It will then start absorbing RADS from 
        your enemies. Once it absorbs enough RADS, the centre will start to glow with a green light.
        If you hit it a couple more times, it will then break, and a green portal will open
         to the crown vault. Inside the crown vault there is a pedestal with a crown on it. This will allow you to choose a crown. 
        Crowns apply a modifier to the game. Modifiers are not fully positive or fully negative, but are very well balanced. The crowns
         effect will be displayed when you hover over it in-game.
