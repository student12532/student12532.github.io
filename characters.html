          <td class="name">Fish</td>
          <td>Fish is a very versatile character, with a wide range of builds you are able to use with him due to his simple nature.</td>
          <td>Gets more ammo. Can dodge roll.</td>
          <td><img class="px" src="https://github.com/student12532/student12532.github.io/blob/main/images/characters/fish.png?raw=true" alt="Fish character sprite"></td>

        <tr>
          <td class="name">Crystal</td>
          <td>The shield deflects most projectiles and prevents melee attacks from hitting. It is an extremely useful tool becuase it can be used to completely counter most attacks. When upgraded with Throne Butt shielding lasts less long but allows you to teleport when it is done.</td>
          <td>More max HP. Can shield.</td>
          <td><img class="px" src="https://github.com/student12532/student12532.github.io/blob/main/images/characters/crystal.png?raw=true" alt="Crystal character sprite"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="name">Eyes</td>
          <td>Eyes can see much further in dark levels than other characters. Telekenesis pulls enemies towards him and slows down projectiles. If you upgrade it, it also pushes them away from you.</td>
          <td>Can see in the dark. Telekenesis.</td>
          <td><img class="px" src="https://github.com/student12532/student12532.github.io/blob/main/images/characters/eyes.png?raw=true" alt="Eyes character sprite"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="name">Melting</td>
          <td>Melting starts with only 2HP but levels up faster and is able to explode corpses. Later he also gains the ability to explode low hp enemies, making him a good choice for experienced players. You can also die in a necromancers circle as him to turn into skeleton.</td>
          <td>Less max HP. More RADS. Can explode corpses.</td>
          <td><img class="px" src="https://github.com/student12532/student12532.github.io/blob/main/images/characters/melting.png?raw=true" alt="Melting character sprite"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="name">Plant</td>
          <td>Plant has the highest base movement speed in the game, and it's snare ability can be extremely useful to hold enemies still while you attack them.</td>
          <td>Is faster. Can snare enemies</td>
          <td><img class="px" src="https://github.com/student12532/student12532.github.io/blob/main/images/characters/plant.png?raw=true" alt="Plant character sprite"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="name">Y.V</td>
          <td>Y.V is my personal favourite character. His increased firerate ability directly raises the amount of damage he does per second. Pop Pop allows him to shoot two bullets at once, however the reload afterwards takes slightly longer. If he upgrades Pop Pop, it turns into Brrapp, which fires four bullets at once instead of two, later in the game, you can choose to upgrade Brrapp again, making it fire 8 bullets, or choose to increase his firerate darastically.</td>
          <td>Higher rate of fire. Pop Pop.</td>
          <td><img class="px" src="https://github.com/student12532/student12532.github.io/blob/main/images/characters/YV.png?raw=true" alt="Y.V character sprite"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="name">Steroids</td>
          <td>Although Steriods is innacurate, being able to fire two weapons very fast at the same time gives him a wide range of melee or gun builds.</td>
          <td>Inaccurate. Automatic weapons. Can dual wield.</td>
          <td><img class="px" src="https://github.com/student12532/student12532.github.io/blob/main/images/characters/steroids.png?raw=true" alt="Steroids character sprite"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="name">Robot</td>
          <td>Being able to eat weapons to heal is extremely useful, making Robot one of the best characters in the game. Finding better tech is also a big plus as you get good weapons a lot earlier than with any other character.</td>
          <td>Finds better tech. Can eat weapons.</td>
          <td><img class="px" src="https://github.com/student12532/student12532.github.io/blob/main/images/characters/robot.png?raw=true" alt="Robot character sprite"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="name">Chicken</td>
          <td>Chickens passive ability, hard to kill, gives you a chance to avoid death. When his health reaches zero, you stay alive for a bit longer as a headless chicken, which gives you an oppurtunity to survive. However, every time you do this you lose one max HP.</td>
          <td>Hard to kill. Can throw weapons.</td>
          <td><img class="px" src="https://github.com/student12532/student12532.github.io/blob/main/images/characters/chicken.png?raw=true" alt="Chicken character sprite"></td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td class="name">Rebel</td>
          <td>Rebel can sacrifice HP to spawn more rebels that will fight for you. Every time you go through a portal to the next level you also heal.</td>
          <td>Portals heal. Can spawn allies.</td>
          <td><img class="px" src="https://github.com/student12532/student12532.github.io/blob/main/images/characters/rebel.png?raw=true" alt="Rebel character sprite"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="name">Horror</td>
          <td>Horror gets to choose from five mutation options instead of four every time you level up. The radiation beam is a highly damaging laser that uses RADS when you fire it. Horror is very good late game when you have leveled up fully, but the mutation beam is risky to use early game.</td>
          <td>Extra mutation choice. Radiation beam.</td>
          <td><img class="px" src="https://github.com/student12532/student12532.github.io/blob/main/images/characters/horror.png?raw=true" alt="Horror character sprite"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="name">Rogue</td>
          <td>The Rogue's Blast Armour causes an explosion every time you are hit that damages enemies nearby. Instead of finding a RADS chest in every level, the Rogue finds a Heat Portal Strike charge, which he can use to summon a large explosion.</td>
          <td>Blast Armour. Heat Portal Strike</td>
          <td><img class="px" src="https://github.com/student12532/student12532.github.io/blob/main/images/characters/rouge.png?raw=true" alt="Rogue character sprite"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="name">Skeleton</td>
          <td>The skeleton is one of the hardest characters to play as. You can't unlock him as a playable character from the menu, instead, you have to die inside a necromancers revival circle as Melting. He may seem bad at first, but in fact, his ability, blood gamble, makes up for his weaknesses. It allows him to fire any weapon without worrying about the ammo cost, but with a chance to lose his HP. This also seems bad at first, but due to the high ammo consumption of later weapons, is actually invaluable.</td>
          <td>Less HP, Less Accuracy, Less Speed, Blood Gamble</td>
          <td><img class="px" src="https://github.com/student12532/student12532.github.io/blob/main/images/characters/skeleton.png?raw=true" alt="Skeleton character sprite"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="name">Frog</td>
          <td>Frog is another hard character to play as. To get him, you must unlock the golden frog pistol, by killing a very late game boss, and then store it. If you equip it, you will then play as frog. He can't stop moving unless you hold down right click. After you release it, a toxic cloud will spread out from him, damaging any enemy it touches.</td>
          <td>Can't stop moving. Toxic cloud.</td>
          <td><img class="px" src="https://github.com/student12532/student12532.github.io/blob/main/images/characters/frog.png?raw=true" alt="Frog character sprite"></td>
